# 299ko

299ko is a flat-file PHP CMS, simple, light and customizable, allowing the creation of showcase sites in a few clicks. It supports [plugins](https://github.com/299Ko/plugins) as well as themes. 299ko is now multilingual,and uses its own template engine (syntax similar to Twig) for creating renderings, in order to make website creation accessible to anyone.

No need for a database: The CMS uses .json files to store its data, which makes maintenance and backups very easy.
